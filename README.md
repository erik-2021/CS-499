## Welcome to my ePortfolio

### Code Review
This video is a code-review of two projects. I review the code and go identify some enhancements that I wish to make. These enhancements will be showcased below.

### Software design and engineering
	OpenGL CS-330 Project
	
     The artifact that I am choosing to use for this portion of my ePortfolio is from an assignment for CS-330 (comp graphic and visualization); this was created last term. This is a C++ project that utilizes OpenGL to render a 3D shape. This artifact is a great choice for my ePortfolio because it showcases multiple different skills. The project is written in C++, so it shows a high level of understanding of this language and how it functions. Using OpenGL shows many skills such as importing and using libraries, using external input to control the camera, and texturing objects in a 3D world. 
	
  This artifact was improved by adding texture to a pyramid which previously just had predefined colors. This required quite a bit of modification to the existing code. The vertex shader and fragment shader had to be modified to accept a texture. The texture had to be loaded from a file, and the shape mesh data had to be modified to accept texture coordinates instead of colors. The render function also had to be modified to bind the texture to the pyramid being displayed.  
The modifications that I made do meet the course objectives; these were the enhancements that I planned to complete for this project. As of now, I don’t have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans since I was able to make all of the changes that I planned. However, I will reevaluate this when I’m completing other projects. If I find that I have inadequate coverage, I will write about these areas in my self-assessment as outlined in the final project rubric. 

  I did learn quite a bit when enhancing this project. I learned how to modify both the vertex and fragment shader code. I then learned how to locate and load an appropriate texture image file. This was challenging to me since many of the images didn’t look professional when applied to the pyramid; I had to find a high-quality image that worked well. I also learned how to modify the shapes mesh data and attrib pointers. This was also challenging to me, since I had to make a lot of changes without being able to test anything until it was completed; I was finally able to get it working after fixing multiple minor mistakes. Everything that I’ve learned in this project will be a great fit for my ePortfolio!
